# Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Name
``` c
Web Patronus
```

## 🚀 Summary
``` c
 Web Patronus is a Chrome extension designed to protect users from unsafe links and online threats in real time. It scans every webpage a user visits, identifies all hyperlinks, and evaluates their safety using a combination of trusted APIs (such as Google Safe Browsing) and heuristic checks like domain age and reputation. Each link receives a “credibility score,” displayed visually using a red–yellow–green system for easy understanding.It will also have random quizing which will be used to level the user from 
```

## ✨ Key Features
``` c
Automated Link Scanning: Instantly scans all links on a webpage for potential risks.

Credibility Scoring: Rates links as safe, suspicious, or dangerous (green, yellow, red).

API Integrations: Uses services such as Google Safe Browsing and domain reputation databases for accurate results.

Heuristic Analysis: Considers factors like domain age, SSL certificate validity, and URL patterns to identify possible phishing or malware.

User-Friendly Interface: Clear color-coded feedback directly on the webpage for quick decisions.

Quiz on cybersecurity which helps level the user :Novice Warden – just starting to protect themselves online

Link Sentinel – learning to spot suspicious links

Cyber Guardian – actively protecting against threats

Phishbane Protector – skilled at detecting scams

Patronus Master – ultimate defender of the web
```

## 💡 Inspiration
``` c
The rise of phishing attacks, malicious ads, and harmful links inspired the creation of Web Patronus. Many existing tools focus on blocking known threats but miss subtle, emerging ones. By combining real-time scanning with heuristic analysis, Web Patronus empowers users to browse more safely and confidently.My Main inspiration for this is the amount of times people I know ,like my grandparents have clicked suspicious links, i want to create something to help prevent this in an easy way.

## 📌 Future Improvements
``` c
AI-Powered Threat Analysis: Incorporate machine learning models to detect new or evolving phishing tactics.

Email Legitimacy Checks: Allow users to verify email senders, links, and headers to identify spoofed or fraudulent communications.

Cookie and Tracker Auditing: Analyze cookies on websites to flag harmful or invasive tracking activity.

Comprehensive Security Dashboard: Provide a unified dashboard summarizing the credibility of links, emails, and cookies.

Community Reporting: Allow users to submit suspicious sites and improve the collective threat database.
